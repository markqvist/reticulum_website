# Community Entrypoints
A number of publicly available entrypoints to Reticulum networks have been provided by the community. For everyday use, it is recommended to use these instead of the testnet.

You can connect your devices or instances to one or more of these to gain access to any Reticulum networks they are physically connected to.

Ideally, set up a Reticulum Transport Node that your own devices can reach locally, and then connect that transport node to a couple of public entrypoints. This will provide efficient connections and redundancy in case any of them go down.
