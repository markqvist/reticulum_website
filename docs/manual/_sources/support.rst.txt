Provide Feedback
================
All feedback on the usage, functioning and potential dysfunctioning of any and
all components of the system is very valuable to the continued development and
improvement of Reticulum.

Absolutely no automated analytics, telemetry, error
reporting or statistics is collected and reported by Reticulum under any
circumstances, so we rely on old-fashioned human feedback.

Contribute Code
===============
Join us on `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/markqvist/reticulum>`_ to
report issues, suggest functionality and contribute code to Reticulum.
