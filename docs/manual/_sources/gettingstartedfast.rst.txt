********************
Getting Started Fast
********************

The best way to get started with the Reticulum Network Stack depends on what
you want to do. This guide will outline sensible starting paths for different
scenarios.


Standalone Reticulum Installation
=============================================
If you simply want to install Reticulum and related utilities on a system,
the easiest way is via the ``pip`` package manager:

.. code::

   pip install rns

If you do not already have pip installed, you can install it using the package manager
of your system with a command like ``sudo apt install python3-pip``,
``sudo pamac install python-pip`` or similar.

You can also dowload the Reticulum release wheels from GitHub, or other release channels,
and install them offline using ``pip``:

.. code::

   pip install ./rns-0.5.1-py3-none-any.whl

For more detailed installation instructions, please see the
:ref:`Platform-Specific Install Notes<install-guides>` section.

After installation is complete, it might be helpful to refer to the
:ref:`Using Reticulum on Your System<using-main>` chapter.

Resolving Dependency & Installation Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On some platforms, there may not be binary packages available for all dependencies, and
``pip`` installation may fail with an error message. In these cases, the issue can usually
be resolved by installing the development essentials packages for your platform:

.. code::

    # Debian / Ubuntu / Derivatives
    sudo apt install build-essential

    # Arch / Manjaro / Derivatives
    sudo pamac install base-devel

    # Fedora
    sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"

With the base development packages installed, ``pip`` should be able to compile any missing
dependencies from source, and complete installation even on platforms that don't have pre-
compiled packages available.

Try Using a Reticulum-based Program
=============================================

If you simply want to try using a program built with Reticulum, a few different
programs exist that allow basic communication and a range of other useful functions,
even over extremely low-bandwidth Reticulum networks.

These programs will let you get a feel for how Reticulum works. They have been designed
to run well over networks based on LoRa or packet radio, but can also be used over fast
links, such as local WiFi, wired Ethernet, the Internet, or any combination.

As such, it is easy to get started experimenting, without having to set up any radio
transceivers or infrastructure just to try it out. Launching the programs on separate
devices connected to the same WiFi network is enough to get started, and physical
radio interfaces can then be added later.

Remote Shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `rnsh <https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh>`_ program lets you establish fully interactive
remote shell sessions over Reticulum. It also allows you to pipe any program to or from a
remote system, and is similar to how ``ssh`` works. The ``rnsh`` is very efficient, and
can facilitate fully interactive shell sessions, even over extremely low-bandwidth links,
such as LoRa or packet radio.

Nomad Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The terminal-based program `Nomad Network <https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet>`_
provides a complete encrypted communications suite built with Reticulum. It features
encrypted messaging (both direct and delayed-delivery for offline users), file sharing,
and has a built-in text-browser and page server with support for dynamically rendered pages,
user authentication and more.

.. image:: screenshots/nomadnet_3.png
    :target: _images/nomadnet_3.png

`Nomad Network <https://github.com/markqvist/nomadnet>`_ is a user-facing client
for the messaging and information-sharing protocol
`LXMF <https://github.com/markqvist/lxmf>`_, another project built with Reticulum.

You can install Nomad Network via pip:

.. code::

   # Install ...
   pip install nomadnet

   # ... and run
   nomadnet

.. note::
   If this is the very first time you use ``pip`` to install a program
   on your system, you might need to reboot your system for your program to become
   available. If you get a "command not found" error or similar when running the
   program, reboot your system and try again. In some cases, you may even need to
   manually add the ``pip`` install path to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

Sideband
^^^^^^^^

If you would rather use a program with a graphical user interface, you can take
a look at `Sideband <https://unsigned.io/sideband>`_, which is available for Android,
Linux, macOS and Windows.

.. only:: html

  .. image:: screenshots/sideband_devices.webp
      :align: center
      :target: _images/sideband_devices.webp

.. only:: latex

  .. image:: screenshots/sideband_devices.png
      :align: center
      :target: _images/sideband_devices.png

Sideband allows you to communicate with other people or LXMF-compatible
systems over Reticulum networks using LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi, I2P, Encrypted QR
Paper Messages, or anything else Reticulum supports. It also interoperates with
the Nomad Network program.

MeshChat
^^^^^^^^

The `Reticulum MeshChat <https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat>`_ application
is a user-friendly LXMF client for macOS and Windows, that also includes voice call
functionality, and a range of other interesting functions.

.. only:: html

.. only:: latex

  .. image:: screenshots/meshchat_1.png
      :align: center
      :target: _images/meshchat_1.png

Reticulum MeshChat is of course also compatible with Sideband and Nomad Network, or
any other LXMF client.

Using the Included Utilities
=============================================
Reticulum comes with a range of included utilities that make it easier to
manage your network, check connectivity and make Reticulum available to other
programs on your system.

You can use ``rnsd`` to run Reticulum as a background or foreground service,
and the ``rnstatus``, ``rnpath`` and ``rnprobe`` utilities to view and query
network status and connectivity.

To learn more about these utility programs, have a look at the
:ref:`Using Reticulum on Your System<using-main>` chapter of this manual.


Creating a Network With Reticulum
=============================================
To create a network, you will need to specify one or more *interfaces* for
Reticulum to use. This is done in the Reticulum configuration file, which by
default is located at ``~/.reticulum/config``. You can get an example
configuration file with all options via ``rnsd --exampleconfig``.

When Reticulum is started for the first time, it will create a default
configuration file, with one active interface. This default interface uses
your existing Ethernet and WiFi networks (if any), and only allows you to
communicate with other Reticulum peers within your local broadcast domains.

To communicate further, you will have to add one or more interfaces. The default
configuration includes a number of examples, ranging from using TCP over the
internet, to LoRa and Packet Radio interfaces.

With Reticulum, you only need to configure what interfaces you want to communicate
over. There is no need to configure address spaces, subnets, routing tables,
or other things you might be used to from other network types.

Once Reticulum knows which interfaces it should use, it will automatically
discover topography and configure transport of data to any destinations it
knows about.

In situations where you already have an established WiFi or Ethernet network, and
many devices that want to utilise the same external Reticulum network paths (for example over
LoRa), it will often be sufficient to let one system act as a Reticulum gateway, by
adding any external interfaces to the configuration of this system, and then enabling transport on it. Any
other device on your local WiFi will then be able to connect to this wider Reticulum
network just using the default (:ref:`AutoInterface<interfaces-auto>`) configuration.

Possibly, the examples in the config file are enough to get you started. If
you want more information, you can read the :ref:`Building Networks<networks-main>`
and :ref:`Interfaces<interfaces-main>` chapters of this manual.

Connecting Reticulum Instances Over the Internet
================================================
Reticulum currently offers two interfaces suitable for connecting instances over the Internet: :ref:`TCP<interfaces-tcps>`
and :ref:`I2P<interfaces-i2p>`. Each interface offers a different set of features, and Reticulum
users should carefully choose the interface which best suites their needs.

The ``TCPServerInterface`` allows users to host an instance accessible over TCP/IP. This
method is generally faster, lower latency, and more energy efficient than using ``I2PInterface``,
however it also leaks more data about the server host.

TCP connections reveal the IP address of both your instance and the server to anyone who can
inspect the connection. Someone could use this information to determine your location or identity. Adversaries
inspecting your packets may be able to record packet metadata like time of transmission and packet size.
Even though Reticulum encrypts traffic, TCP does not, so an adversary may be able to use
packet inspection to learn that a system is running Reticulum, and what other IP addresses connect to it.
Hosting a publicly reachable instance over TCP also requires a publicly reachable IP address,
which most Internet connections don't offer anymore.

The ``I2PInterface`` routes messages through the `Invisible Internet Protocol
(I2P) <https://geti2p.net/en/>`_. To use this interface, users must also run an I2P daemon in
parallel to ``rnsd``. For always-on I2P nodes it is recommended to use `i2pd <https://i2pd.website/>`_.

By default, I2P will encrypt and mix all traffic sent over the Internet, and
hide both the sender and receiver Reticulum instance IP addresses. Running an I2P node
will also relay other I2P user's encrypted packets, which will use extra
bandwidth and compute power, but also makes timing attacks and other forms of
deep-packet-inspection much more difficult.

I2P also allows users to host globally available Reticulum instances from non-public IP's and behind firewalls and NAT.

In general it is recommended to use an I2P node if you want to host a publicly accessible
instance, while preserving anonymity. If you care more about performance, and a slightly
easier setup, use TCP.


Connect to the Public Testnet
===========================================

An experimental public testnet has been made accessible over both I2P and TCP. You can join it
by adding one of the following interfaces to your ``.reticulum/config`` file:

.. code::

  # TCP/IP interface to the RNS Amsterdam Hub
  [[RNS Testnet Amsterdam]]
    type = TCPClientInterface
    enabled = yes
    target_host = amsterdam.connect.reticulum.network
    target_port = 4965

  # TCP/IP interface to the BetweenTheBorders Hub (community-provided)
  [[RNS Testnet BetweenTheBorders]]
    type = TCPClientInterface
    enabled = yes
    target_host = reticulum.betweentheborders.com
    target_port = 4242

  # Interface to Testnet I2P Hub
  [[RNS Testnet I2P Hub]]
    type = I2PInterface
    enabled = yes
    peers = g3br23bvx3lq5uddcsjii74xgmn6y5q325ovrkq2zw2wbzbqgbuq.b32.i2p

Many other Reticulum instances are connecting to this testnet, and you can also join it
via other entry points if you know them. There is absolutely no control over the network
topography, usage or what types of instances connect. It will also occasionally be used
to test various failure scenarios, and there are no availability or service guarantees.
Expect weird things to happen on this network, as people experiment and try out things.

It probably goes without saying, but *don't use the testnet entry-points as 
hardcoded or default interfaces in any applications you ship to users*. When
shipping applications, the best practice is to provide your own default
connectivity solutions, if needed and applicable, or in most cases, simply
leave it up to the user which networks to connect to, and how.


Adding Radio Interfaces
==============================================
Once you have Reticulum installed and working, you can add radio interfaces with
any compatible hardware you have available. Reticulum supports a wide range of radio
hardware, and if you already have any available, it is very likely that it will
work with Reticulum. For information on how to configure this, see the
:ref:`Interfaces<interfaces-main>` section of this manual.

If you do not already have transceiver hardware available, you can easily and
cheaply build an :ref:`RNode<rnode-main>`, which is a general-purpose long-range
digital radio transceiver, that integrates easily with Reticulum.

To build one yourself requires installing a custom firmware on a supported LoRa
development board with an auto-install script. Please see the :ref:`Communications Hardware<hardware-main>`
chapter for a guide. If you prefer purchasing a ready-made unit, you can refer to the
:ref:`list of suppliers<rnode-suppliers>`. For more information on RNode, you can also
refer to these additional external resources:

* `How To Make Your Own RNodes <https://unsigned.io/how-to-make-your-own-rnodes/>`_
* `Installing RNode Firmware on Compatible LoRa Devices <https://unsigned.io/installing-rnode-firmware-on-supported-devices/>`_
* `Private, Secure and Uncensorable Messaging Over a LoRa Mesh <https://unsigned.io/private-messaging-over-lora/>`_
* `RNode Firmware <https://github.com/markqvist/RNode_Firmware/>`_

If you have communications hardware that is not already supported by any of the
:ref:`existing interface types<interfaces-main>`, but you think would be suitable for use with Reticulum,
you are welcome to head over to the `GitHub discussion pages <https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/discussions>`_
and propose adding an interface for the hardware.


Creating and Using Custom Interfaces
===========================================

While Reticulum includes a flexible and broad range of built-in interfaces, these
will not cover every conceivable type of communications hardware that Reticulum
can potentially use to communicate.

It is therefore possible to easily write your own interface modules, that can be
loaded at run-time and used on-par with any of the built-in interface types.

For more information on this subject, and code examples to build on, please see
the :ref:`Configuring Interfaces<interfaces-main>` chapter.


Develop a Program with Reticulum
===========================================
If you want to develop programs that use Reticulum, the easiest way to get
started is to install the latest release of Reticulum via pip:

.. code::

   pip install rns

The above command will install Reticulum and dependencies, and you will be
ready to import and use RNS in your own programs. The next step will most
likely be to look at some :ref:`Example Programs<examples-main>`.

The entire Reticulum API is documented in the :ref:`API Reference<api-main>`
chapter of this manual.


Participate in Reticulum Development
==============================================
If you want to participate in the development of Reticulum and associated
utilities, you'll want to get the latest source from GitHub. In that case,
don't use pip, but try this recipe:

.. code::

    # Install dependencies
    pip install cryptography pyserial

    # Clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum.git

    # Move into Reticulum folder and symlink library to examples folder
    cd Reticulum
    ln -s ../RNS ./Examples/

    # Run an example
    python Examples/Echo.py -s

    # Unless you've manually created a config file, Reticulum will do so now,
    # and immediately exit. Make any necessary changes to the file:
    nano ~/.reticulum/config

    # ... and launch the example again.
    python Examples/Echo.py -s

    # You can now repeat the process on another computer,
    # and run the same example with -h to get command line options.
    python Examples/Echo.py -h

    # Run the example in client mode to "ping" the server.
    # Replace the hash below with the actual destination hash of your server.
    python Examples/Echo.py 174a64852a75682259ad8b921b8bf416

    # Have a look at another example
    python Examples/Filetransfer.py -h

When you have experimented with the basic examples, it's time to go read the
:ref:`Understanding Reticulum<understanding-main>` chapter. Before submitting
your first pull request, it is probably a good idea to introduce yourself on
the `disucssion forum on GitHub <https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum/discussions>`_,
or ask one of the developers or maintainers for a good place to start.

Platform-Specific Install Notes
==============================================

Some platforms require a slightly different installation procedure, or have
various quirks that are worth being aware of. These are listed here.

Android
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reticulum can be used on Android in different ways. The easiest way to get
started is using an app like `Sideband <https://unsigned.io/sideband>`_.

For more control and features, you can use Reticulum and related programs via
the `Termux app <https://termux.com/>`_, at the time of writing available on
`F-droid <https://f-droid.org>`_.

Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android based devices,
which includes the ability to use many different programs and libraries,
including Reticulum.

To use Reticulum within the Termux environment, you will need to install
``python`` and the ``python-cryptography`` library using ``pkg``, the package-manager
build into Termux. After that, you can use ``pip`` to install Reticulum.

From within Termux, execute the following:

.. code::

    # First, make sure indexes and packages are up to date.
    pkg update
    pkg upgrade

    # Then install python and the cryptography library.
    pkg install python python-cryptography

    # Make sure pip is up to date, and install the wheel module.
    pip install wheel pip --upgrade

    # Install Reticulum
    pip install rns

If for some reason the ``python-cryptography`` package is not available for
your platform via the Termux package manager, you can attempt to build it
locally on your device using the following command:

.. code::

    # First, make sure indexes and packages are up to date.
    pkg update
    pkg upgrade

    # Then install dependencies for the cryptography library.
    pkg install python build-essential openssl libffi rust

    # Make sure pip is up to date, and install the wheel module.
    pip install wheel pip --upgrade

    # To allow the installer to build the cryptography module,
    # we need to let it know what platform we are compiling for:
    export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET="aarch64-linux-android"

    # Start the install process for the cryptography module.
    # Depending on your device, this can take several minutes,
    # since the module must be compiled locally on your device.
    pip install cryptography

    # If the above installation succeeds, you can now install
    # Reticulum and any related software
    pip install rns

It is also possible to include Reticulum in apps compiled and distributed as
Android APKs. A detailed tutorial and example source code will be included
here at a later point. Until then you can use the `Sideband source code <https://github.com/markqvist/sideband>`_ as an example and starting point.


ARM64
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On some architectures, including ARM64, not all dependencies have precompiled
binaries. On such systems, you may need to install ``python3-dev`` (or similar) before
installing Reticulum or programs that depend on Reticulum.

.. code::

   # Install Python and development packages
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev

   # Install Reticulum
   python3 -m pip install rns

With these packages installed, ``pip`` will be able to build any missing dependencies
on your system locally.


Debian Bookworm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On versions of Debian released after April 2023, it is no longer possible by default
to use ``pip`` to install packages onto your system. Unfortunately, you will need to
use the replacement ``pipx`` command instead, which places installed packages in an
isolated environment. This should not negatively affect Reticulum, but will not work
for including and using Reticulum in your own scripts and programs.

.. code::

    # Install pipx
    sudo apt install pipx

    # Make installed programs available on the command line
    pipx ensurepath

    # Install Reticulum
    pipx install rns

Alternatively, you can restore normal behaviour to ``pip`` by creating or editing
the configuration file located at ``~/.config/pip/pip.conf``, and adding the
following section:

.. code:: text

    [global]
    break-system-packages = true

For a one-shot installation of Reticulum, without globally enabling the ``break-system-packages``
option, you can use the following command:

.. code:: text

    pip install rns --break-system-packages

.. note::
   The ``--break-system-packages`` directive is a somewhat misleading choice
   of words. Setting it will of course not break any system packages, but will simply
   allow installing ``pip`` packages user- and system-wide. While this *could* in rare
   cases lead to version conflicts, it does not generally pose any problems, especially
   not in the case of installing Reticulum.


MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install Reticulum on macOS, you will need to have Python and the ``pip`` package
manager installed.

Systems running macOS can vary quite widely in whether or not Python is pre-installed,
and if it is, which version is installed, and whether the ``pip`` package manager is
also installed and set up. If in doubt, you can `download and install <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
Python manually.

When Python and ``pip`` is available on your system, simply open a terminal window
and use one of the following commands:

.. code::

   # Install Reticulum and utilities with pip:
   pip3 install rns
   
   # On some versions, you may need to use the
   # flag --break-system-packages to install:
   pip3 install rns --break-system-packages

.. note::
   The ``--break-system-packages`` directive is a somewhat misleading choice
   of words. Setting it will of course not break any system packages, but will simply
   allow installing ``pip`` packages user- and system-wide. While this *could* in rare
   cases lead to version conflicts, it does not generally pose any problems, especially
   not in the case of installing Reticulum.

Additionally, some version combinations of macOS and Python require you to
manually add your installed ``pip`` packages directory to your `PATH` environment
variable, before you can use installed commands in your terminal. Usually, adding
the following line to your shell init script (for example ``~/.zshrc``) will be enough:

.. code::

   export PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Python/3.9/bin

Adjust Python version and shell init script location according to your system.


OpenWRT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On OpenWRT systems with sufficient storage and memory, you can install
Reticulum and related utilities using the `opkg` package manager and `pip`.

.. note::

   At the time of releasing this manual, work is underway to create pre-built
   Reticulum packages for OpenWRT, with full configuration, service
   and ``uci`` integration. Please see the `feed-reticulum <https://github.com/gretel/feed-reticulum>`_
   and `reticulum-openwrt <https://github.com/gretel/reticulum-openwrt>`_
   repositories for more information.

To install Reticulum on OpenWRT, first log into a command line session, and
then use the following instructions:

.. code::

   # Install dependencies
   opkg install python3 python3-pip python3-cryptography python3-pyserial
   
   # Install Reticulum
   pip install rns

   # Start rnsd with debug logging enabled
   rnsd -vvv

.. note::
   
   The above instructions have been verified and tested on OpenWRT 21.02 only.
   It is likely that other versions may require slightly altered installation
   commands or package names. You will also need enough free space in your
   overlay FS, and enough free RAM to actually run Reticulum and any related
   programs and utilities.

Depending on your device configuration, you may need to adjust firewall rules
for Reticulum connectivity to and from your device to work. Until proper
packaging is ready, you will also need to manually create a service or startup
script to automatically laucnh Reticulum at boot time.

Please also note that the `AutoInterface` requires link-local IPv6 addresses
to be enabled for any Ethernet and WiFi devices you intend to use. If ``ip a``
shows an address starting with ``fe80::`` for the device in question,
``AutoInterface`` should work for that device.

Raspberry Pi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is currently recommended to use a 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS
if you want to run Reticulum on Raspberry Pi computers, since 32-bit versions
don't always have packages available for some dependencies. If Python and the
`pip` package manager is not already installed, do that first, and then
install Reticulum using `pip`.

.. code::

   # Install dependencies
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-cryptography python3-pyserial
   
   # Install Reticulum
   pip install rns --break-system-packages

.. note::
   The ``--break-system-packages`` directive is a somewhat misleading choice
   of words. Setting it will of course not break any system packages, but will simply
   allow installing ``pip`` packages user- and system-wide. While this *could* in rare
   cases lead to version conflicts, it does not generally pose any problems, especially
   not in the case of installing Reticulum.

While it is possible to install and run Reticulum on 32-bit Rasperry Pi OSes,
it will require manually configuring and installing required build dependencies,
and is not detailed in this manual.


RISC-V
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On some architectures, including RISC-V, not all dependencies have precompiled
binaries. On such systems, you may need to install ``python3-dev`` (or similar) before
installing Reticulum or programs that depend on Reticulum.

.. code::

   # Install Python and development packages
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev

   # Install Reticulum
   python3 -m pip install rns

With these packages installed, ``pip`` will be able to build any missing dependencies
on your system locally.


Ubuntu Lunar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On versions of Ubuntu released after April 2023, it is no longer possible by default
to use ``pip`` to install packages onto your system. Unfortunately, you will need to
use the replacement ``pipx`` command instead, which places installed packages in an
isolated environment. This should not negatively affect Reticulum, but will not work
for including and using Reticulum in your own scripts and programs.

.. code::

    # Install pipx
    sudo apt install pipx

    # Make installed programs available on the command line
    pipx ensurepath

    # Install Reticulum
    pipx install rns

Alternatively, you can restore normal behaviour to ``pip`` by creating or editing
the configuration file located at ``~/.config/pip/pip.conf``, and adding the
following section:

.. code:: text

    [global]
    break-system-packages = true

For a one-shot installation of Reticulum, without globally enabling the ``break-system-packages``
option, you can use the following command:

.. code:: text

    pip install rns --break-system-packages

.. note::
   The ``--break-system-packages`` directive is a somewhat misleading choice
   of words. Setting it will of course not break any system packages, but will simply
   allow installing ``pip`` packages user- and system-wide. While this *could* in rare
   cases lead to version conflicts, it does not generally pose any problems, especially
   not in the case of installing Reticulum.

Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On Windows operating systems, the easiest way to install Reticulum is by using the
``pip`` package manager from the command line (either the command prompt or Windows
Powershell).

If you don't already have Python installed, `download and install Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
At the time of publication of this manual, the recommended version is `Python 3.12.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127>`_.

**Important!** When asked by the installer, make sure to add the Python program to
your PATH environment variables. If you don't do this, you will not be able to
use the ``pip`` installer, or run the included Reticulum utility programs (such as
``rnsd`` and ``rnstatus``) from the command line.

After installing Python, open the command prompt or Windows Powershell, and type:

.. code::

   pip install rns

You can now use Reticulum and all included utility programs directly from your
preferred command line interface.

Pure-Python Reticulum
==============================================

.. warning::
   If you use the ``rnspure`` package to run Reticulum on systems that
   do not support `PyCA/cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography>`_, it is
   important that you read and understand the :ref:`Cryptographic Primitives <understanding-primitives>`
   section of this manual.

In some rare cases, and on more obscure system types, it is not possible to
install one or more dependencies. In such situations,
you can use the ``rnspure`` package instead of the ``rns`` package, or use ``pip``
with the ``--no-dependencies`` command-line option. The ``rnspure``
package requires no external dependencies for installation. Please note that the
actual contents of the ``rns`` and ``rnspure`` packages are *completely identical*.
The only difference is that the ``rnspure`` package lists no dependencies required
for installation.

No matter how Reticulum is installed and started, it will load external dependencies
only if they are *needed* and *available*. If for example you want to use Reticulum
on a system that cannot support ``pyserial``, it is perfectly possible to do so using
the `rnspure` package, but Reticulum will not be able to use serial-based interfaces.
All other available modules will still be loaded when needed.
