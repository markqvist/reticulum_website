******************************
Using Reticulum on Your System
******************************

Reticulum is not installed as a driver or kernel module, as one might expect
of a networking stack. Instead, Reticulum is distributed as a Python module, 
containing the networking core, and a set of utility and daemon programs.

This means that no special privileges are required to install or use it. It
is also very light-weight, and easy to transfer to, and install on new systems.

When you have Reticulum installed, any program or application that uses Reticulum
will automatically load and initialise Reticulum when it starts, if it is not
already running.

In many cases, this approach is sufficient. When any program needs to use
Reticulum, it is loaded, initialised, interfaces are brought up, and the
program can now communicate over any Reticulum networks available. If another
program starts up and also wants access to the same Reticulum network, the already
running instance is simply shared. This works for any number of programs running
concurrently, and is very easy to use, but depending on your use case, there
are other options.

Configuration & Data
--------------------

Reticulum stores all information that it needs to function in a single file-system
directory. When Reticulum is started, it will look for a valid configuration
directory in the following places:

- ``/etc/reticulum``
- ``~/.config/reticulum``
- ``~/.reticulum``

If no existing configuration directory is found, the directory ``~/.reticulum``
is created, and the default configuration will be automatically created here.
You can move it to one of the other locations if you wish.

It is also possible to use completely arbitrary configuration directories by
specifying the relevant command-line parameters when running Reticulum-based
programs. You can also run multiple separate Reticulum instances on the same
physical system, either in isolation from each other, or connected together.

In most cases, a single physical system will only need to run one Reticulum
instance. This can either be launched at boot, as a system service, or simply
be brought up when a program needs it. In either case, any number of programs
running on the same system will automatically share the same Reticulum instance,
if the configuration allows for it, which it does by default.

The entire configuration of Reticulum is found in the ``~/.reticulum/config``
file. When Reticulum is first started on a new system, a basic, but fully functional
configuration file is created. The default configuration looks like this:

.. code::

  # This is the default Reticulum config file.
  # You should probably edit it to include any additional,
  # interfaces and settings you might need.

  # Only the most basic options are included in this default
  # configuration. To see a more verbose, and much longer,
  # configuration example, you can run the command:
  # rnsd --exampleconfig


  [reticulum]

  # If you enable Transport, your system will route traffic
  # for other peers, pass announces and serve path requests.
  # This should be done for systems that are suited to act
  # as transport nodes, ie. if they are stationary and
  # always-on. This directive is optional and can be removed
  # for brevity.

  enable_transport = No


  # By default, the first program to launch the Reticulum
  # Network Stack will create a shared instance, that other
  # programs can communicate with. Only the shared instance
  # opens all the configured interfaces directly, and other
  # local programs communicate with the shared instance over
  # a local socket. This is completely transparent to the
  # user, and should generally be turned on. This directive
  # is optional and can be removed for brevity.

  share_instance = Yes


  # If you want to run multiple *different* shared instances
  # on the same system, you will need to specify different
  # instance names for each. On platforms supporting domain
  # sockets, this can be done with the instance_name option:

  instance_name = default

  # Some platforms don't support domain sockets, and if that
  # is the case, you can isolate different instances by
  # specifying a unique set of ports for each:

  # shared_instance_port = 37428
  # instance_control_port = 37429


  # If you want to explicitly use TCP for shared instance
  # communication, instead of domain sockets, this is also
  # possible, by using the following option:

  # shared_instance_type = tcp


  # On systems where running instances may not have access
  # to the same shared Reticulum configuration directory,
  # it is still possible to allow full interactivity for
  # running instances, by manually specifying a shared RPC
  # key. In almost all cases, this option is not needed, but
  # it can be useful on operating systems such as Android.
  # The key must be specified as bytes in hexadecimal.

  # rpc_key = e5c032d3ec4e64a6aca9927ba8ab73336780f6d71790


  # It is possible to allow remote management of Reticulum
  # systems using the various built-in utilities, such as
  # rnstatus and rnpath. You will need to specify one or
  # more Reticulum Identity hashes for authenticating the
  # queries from client programs. For this purpose, you can
  # use existing identity files, or generate new ones with
  # the rnid utility.

  # enable_remote_management = yes
  # remote_management_allowed = 9fb6d773498fb3feda407ed8ef2c3229, 2d882c5586e548d79b5af27bca1776dc


  # You can configure Reticulum to panic and forcibly close
  # if an unrecoverable interface error occurs, such as the
  # hardware device for an interface disappearing. This is
  # an optional directive, and can be left out for brevity.
  # This behaviour is disabled by default.

  # panic_on_interface_error = No


  # When Transport is enabled, it is possible to allow the
  # Transport Instance to respond to probe requests from
  # the rnprobe utility. This can be a useful tool to test
  # connectivity. When this option is enabled, the probe
  # destination will be generated from the Identity of the
  # Transport Instance, and printed to the log at startup.
  # Optional, and disabled by default.

  # respond_to_probes = No


  [logging]
  # Valid log levels are 0 through 7:
  #   0: Log only critical information
  #   1: Log errors and lower log levels
  #   2: Log warnings and lower log levels
  #   3: Log notices and lower log levels
  #   4: Log info and lower (this is the default)
  #   5: Verbose logging
  #   6: Debug logging
  #   7: Extreme logging

  loglevel = 4


  # The interfaces section defines the physical and virtual
  # interfaces Reticulum will use to communicate on. This
  # section will contain examples for a variety of interface
  # types. You can modify these or use them as a basis for
  # your own config, or simply remove the unused ones.

  [interfaces]

    # This interface enables communication with other
    # link-local Reticulum nodes over UDP. It does not
    # need any functional IP infrastructure like routers
    # or DHCP servers, but will require that at least link-
    # local IPv6 is enabled in your operating system, which
    # should be enabled by default in almost any OS. See
    # the Reticulum Manual for more configuration options.

    [[Default Interface]]
      type = AutoInterface
      interface_enabled = True

If Reticulum infrastructure already exists locally, you probably don't need to
change anything, and you may already be connected to a wider network. If not,
you will probably need to add relevant *interfaces* to the configuration, in
order to communicate with other systems.

You can generate a much more verbose configuration example by running the command:

``rnsd --exampleconfig``

The output includes examples for most interface types supported
by Reticulum, along with additional options and configuration parameters.

It is a good idea to read the comments and explanations in the above default config.
It will teach you the basic concepts you need to understand to configure your network.
Once you have done that, take a look at the :ref:`Interfaces<interfaces-main>` chapter
of this manual.

Included Utility Programs
-------------------------

Reticulum includes a range of useful utilities, both for managing your Reticulum
networks, and for carrying out common tasks over Reticulum networks, such as
transferring files to remote systems, and executing commands and programs remotely.

If you often use Reticulum from several different programs, or simply want
Reticulum to stay available all the time, for example if you are hosting
a transport node, you might want to run Reticulum as a separate service that
other programs, applications and services can utilise.

The rnsd Utility
================

It is very easy to run Reticulum as a service. Simply run the included ``rnsd`` command.
When ``rnsd`` is running, it will keep all configured interfaces open, handle transport if
it is enabled, and allow any other programs to immediately utilise the
Reticulum network it is configured for.

You can even run multiple instances of ``rnsd`` with different configurations on
the same system.

**Usage Examples**

Run ``rnsd``:

.. code:: text

  $ rnsd

  [2023-08-18 17:59:56] [Notice] Started rnsd version 0.5.8

Run ``rnsd`` in service mode, ensuring all logging output is sent directly to file:

.. code:: text

  $ rnsd -s

Generate a verbose and detailed configuration example, with explanations of all the
various configuration options, and interface configuration examples:

.. code:: text

  $ rnsd --exampleconfig

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

  usage: rnsd.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [-v] [-q] [-s] [--exampleconfig] [--version]

  Reticulum Network Stack Daemon

  options:
    -h, --help       show this help message and exit
    --config CONFIG  path to alternative Reticulum config directory
    -v, --verbose
    -q, --quiet
    -s, --service    rnsd is running as a service and should log to file
    --exampleconfig  print verbose configuration example to stdout and exit
    --version        show program's version number and exit

You can easily add ``rnsd`` as an always-on service by :ref:`configuring a service<using-systemd>`.

The rnstatus Utility
====================

Using the ``rnstatus`` utility, you can view the status of configured Reticulum
interfaces, similar to the ``ifconfig`` program.

**Usage Examples**

Run ``rnstatus``:

.. code:: text

  $ rnstatus

  Shared Instance[37428]
     Status  : Up
     Serving : 1 program
     Rate    : 1.00 Gbps

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

  usage: rnstatus [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--version] [-a] [-A]
                  [-l] [-s SORT] [-r] [-j] [-R hash] [-i path]
                  [-w seconds] [-v] [filter]

  Reticulum Network Stack Status

  positional arguments:
    filter                only display interfaces with names including filter

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --config CONFIG       path to alternative Reticulum config directory
    --version             show program's version number and exit
    -a, --all             show all interfaces
    -A, --announce-stats  show announce stats
    -l, --link-stats      show link stats
    -s SORT, --sort SORT  sort interfaces by [rate, traffic, rx, tx, announces, arx, atx, held]
    -r, --reverse         reverse sorting
    -j, --json            output in JSON format
    -R hash               transport identity hash of remote instance to get status from (requires -i)
    -i path               path to identity used for remote management
    -w seconds            timeout before giving up on remote queries
    -v, --verbose


.. note::
   When using ``-R`` to query a remote transport instance, you must also specify ``-i`` with the path to a management identity file that is authorized for remote management on the target system.

The rnid Utility
====================

With the ``rnid`` utility, you can generate, manage and view Reticulum Identities.
The program can also calculate Destination hashes, and perform encryption and
decryption of files.

Using ``rnid``, it is possible to asymmetrically encrypt files and information for
any Reticulum destination hash, and also to create and verify cryptographic signatures.

**Usage Examples**

Generate a new Identity:

.. code:: text

  $ rnid -g ./new_identity

Display Identity key information:

.. code:: text

  $ rnid -i ./new_identity -p

  Loaded Identity <984b74a3f768bef236af4371e6f248cd> from new_id
  Public Key  : 0f4259fef4521ab75a3409e353fe9073eb10783b4912a6a9937c57bf44a62c1e
  Private Key : Hidden

Encrypt a file for an LXMF user:

.. code:: text

  $ rnid -i 8dd57a738226809646089335a6b03695 -e my_file.txt

  Recalled Identity <bc7291552be7a58f361522990465165c> for destination <8dd57a738226809646089335a6b03695>
  Encrypting my_file.txt
  File my_file.txt encrypted for <bc7291552be7a58f361522990465165c> to my_file.txt.rfe

If the Identity for the destination is not already known, you can fetch it from the network by using the ``-R`` command-line option:

.. code:: text

  $ rnid -R -i 30602def3b3506a28ed33db6f60cc6c9 -e my_file.txt

  Requesting unknown Identity for <30602def3b3506a28ed33db6f60cc6c9>...
  Received Identity <2b489d06eaf7c543808c76a5332a447d> for destination <30602def3b3506a28ed33db6f60cc6c9> from the network
  Encrypting my_file.txt
  File my_file.txt encrypted for <2b489d06eaf7c543808c76a5332a447d> to my_file.txt.rfe

Decrypt a file using the Reticulum Identity it was encrypted for:

.. code:: text

  $ rnid -i ./my_identity -d my_file.txt.rfe

  Loaded Identity <2225fdeecaf6e2db4556c3c2d7637294> from ./my_identity
  Decrypting ./my_file.txt.rfe...
  File ./my_file.txt.rfe decrypted with <2225fdeecaf6e2db4556c3c2d7637294> to ./my_file.txt

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

The rnpath Utility
====================

With the ``rnpath`` utility, you can look up and view paths for
destinations on the Reticulum network.

**Usage Examples**

Resolve path to a destination:

.. code:: text

  $ rnpath c89b4da064bf66d280f0e4d8abfd9806

  Path found, destination <c89b4da064bf66d280f0e4d8abfd9806> is 4 hops away via <f53a1c4278e0726bb73fcc623d6ce763> on TCPInterface[Testnet/dublin.connect.reticulum.network:4965]

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

  usage: rnpath [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--version] [-t] [-m hops]
                [-r] [-d] [-D] [-x] [-w seconds] [-R hash] [-i path]
                [-W seconds] [-j] [-v] [destination]

  Reticulum Path Discovery Utility

  positional arguments:
    destination           hexadecimal hash of the destination

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --config CONFIG       path to alternative Reticulum config directory
    --version             show program's version number and exit

    -D, --drop-announces  drop all queued announces
    -x, --drop-via        drop all paths via specified transport instance
    -w seconds            timeout before giving up
    -R hash               transport identity hash of remote instance to manage
    -i path               path to identity used for remote management
    -W seconds            timeout before giving up on remote queries
    -j, --json            output in JSON format
    -v, --verbose


The rnprobe Utility
====================

The ``rnprobe`` utility lets you probe a destination for connectivity, similar
to the ``ping`` program. Please note that probes will only be answered if the
specified destination is configured to send proofs for received packets. Many
destinations will not have this option enabled, so most destinations will not
be probable.

You can enable a probe-reply destination on Reticulum Transport Instances by
setting the ``respond_to_probes`` configuration directive. Reticulum will then
print the probe destination to the log on Transport Instance startup.

**Usage Examples**

Probe a destination:

.. code:: text

  $ rnprobe rnstransport.probe 2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708

  Sent 16 byte probe to <2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708>
  Valid reply received from <2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708>
  Round-trip time is 38.469 milliseconds over 2 hops

Send a larger probe:

.. code:: text

  $ rnprobe rnstransport.probe 2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708 -s 256

  Sent 16 byte probe to <2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708>
  Valid reply received from <2d03725b327348980d570f739a3a5708>
  Round-trip time is 38.781 milliseconds over 2 hops

If the interface that receives the probe replies supports reporting radio
parameters such as **RSSI** and **SNR**, the ``rnprobe`` utility will print
these as part of the result as well.

.. code:: text

  $ rnprobe rnstransport.probe e7536ee90bd4a440e130490b87a25124
  
  Sent 16 byte probe to <e7536ee90bd4a440e130490b87a25124>
  Valid reply received from <e7536ee90bd4a440e130490b87a25124>
  Round-trip time is 1.809 seconds over 1 hop [RSSI -73 dBm] [SNR 12.0 dB]

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

  usage: rnprobe [-h] [--config CONFIG] [-s SIZE] [-n PROBES]
                 [-t seconds] [-w seconds] [--version] [-v]
                 [full_name] [destination_hash]

    -w seconds, --wait seconds
                          time between each probe
    --version             show program's version number and exit
    -v, --verbose


The rncp Utility
================

The ``rncp`` utility is a simple file transfer tool. Using it, you can transfer
files through Reticulum.

**Usage Examples**

Run rncp on the receiving system, specifying which identities are allowed to send files:
  
.. code:: text

  $ rncp --listen -a 1726dbad538775b5bf9b0ea25a4079c8 -a c50cc4e4f7838b6c31f60ab9032cbc62

You can also specify allowed identity hashes (one per line) in the file ~/.rncp/allowed_identities
and simply running the program in listener mode:

.. code:: text

  $ rncp --listen

From another system, copy a file to the receiving system:

.. code:: text

  $ rncp ~/path/to/file.tgz 73cbd378bb0286ed11a707c13447bb1e

Or fetch a file from the remote system:

.. code:: text

  $ rncp --fetch ~/path/to/file.tgz 73cbd378bb0286ed11a707c13447bb1e

**All Command-Line Options**

.. code:: text

  usage: rncp [-h] [--config path] [-v] [-q] [-S] [-l] [-F] [-f]
              [-j path] [-b seconds] [-a allowed_hash] [-n] [-p]
              [-w seconds] [--version] [file] [destination]

  Reticulum File Transfer Utility

  positional arguments:
    file                  file to be transferred
    destination           hexadecimal hash of the receiver

  options:

    --config path         path to alternative Reticulum config directory
    -v, --verbose         increase verbosity
    -q, --quiet           decrease verbosity
    -S, --silent          disable transfer progress output
    -l, --listen          listen for incoming transfer requests
    -F, --allow-fetch     allow authenticated clients to fetch files
    -f, --fetch           fetch file from remote listener instead of sending

The rnx Utility
================

The ``rnx`` utility is a basic remote command execution program. It allows you to
execute commands on remote systems over Reticulum, and to view returned command
output. For a fully interactive remote shell solution, be sure to also take a look
at the `rnsh <https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh>`_ program.

**Usage Examples**

Run rnx on the listening system, specifying which identities are allowed to execute commands:

.. code:: text

  $ rnx --listen -a 941bed5e228775e5a8079fc38b1ccf3f -a 1b03013c25f1c2ca068a4f080b844a10

From another system, run a command on the remote:

.. code:: text

  $ rnx 7a55144adf826958a9529a3bcf08b149 "cat /proc/cpuinfo"

Or enter the interactive mode pseudo-shell:

.. code:: text

  $ rnx 7a55144adf826958a9529a3bcf08b149 -x

The default identity file is stored in ``~/.reticulum/identities/rnx``, but you can use
another one, which will be created if it does not already exist 

.. code:: text

  $ rnx 7a55144adf826958a9529a3bcf08b149 -i /path/to/identity -x

**All Command-Line Options**

Remote Management
-----------------

It is possible to allow remote management of Reticulum
systems using the various built-in utilities, such as
``rnstatus`` and ``rnpath``. To do so, you will need to set
the ``enable_remote_management`` directive in the ``[reticulum]``
section of the configuration file. You will also need to specify
one or more Reticulum Identity hashes for authenticating the
queries from client programs. For this purpose, you can use
existing identity files, or generate new ones with the rnid utility.

The following is a truncated example of enabling remote management
in the Reticulum configuration file:

.. code:: text
  
  [reticulum]
  ...
  enable_remote_management = yes
  remote_management_allowed = 9fb6d773498fb3feda407ed8ef2c3229, 2d882c5586e548d79b5af27bca1776dc
  ...

For a complete example configuration, you can run ``rnsd --exampleconfig``.

Improving System Configuration
------------------------------

If you are setting up a system for permanent use with Reticulum, there is a
few system configuration changes that can make this easier to administrate.
These changes will be detailed here.


Fixed Serial Port Names
=======================

On a Reticulum instance with several serial port based interfaces, it can be
beneficial to use the fixed device names for the serial ports, instead
of the dynamically allocated shorthands such as ``/dev/ttyUSB0``. Under most
Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi OS, these nodes
can be found under ``/dev/serial/by-id``.

You can use such a device path directly in place of the numbered shorthands.
Here is an example of a packet radio TNC configured as such:

.. code:: text

  [[Packet Radio KISS Interface]]
    type = KISSInterface
    interface_enabled = True
    outgoing = true
    port = /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT230X_Basic_UART_43891CKM-if00-port0
    speed = 115200    
    databits = 8
    parity = none
    stopbits = 1
    preamble = 150
    txtail = 10
    persistence = 200
    slottime = 20

Using this methodology avoids potential naming mix-ups where physical devices
might be plugged and unplugged in different orders, or when device name
assignment varies from one boot to another.

.. _using-systemd:

Reticulum as a System Service
=============================

Instead of starting Reticulum manually, you can install ``rnsd`` as a system
service and have it start automatically at boot.

Systemwide Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you installed Reticulum with ``pip``, the ``rnsd`` program will most likely
be located in a user-local installation path only, which means ``systemd`` will not
be able to execute it. In this case, you can simply symlink the ``rnsd`` program
into a directory that is in systemd's path:

.. code:: text

  sudo ln -s $(which rnsd) /usr/local/bin/

You can then create the service file ``/etc/systemd/system/rnsd.service`` with the
following content:

.. code:: text

  [Unit]
  Description=Reticulum Network Stack Daemon
  After=multi-user.target

  [Service]
  # If you run Reticulum on WiFi devices,
  # or other devices that need some extra
  # time to initialise, you might want to
  # add a short delay before Reticulum is
  # started by systemd:
  # ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
  Type=simple
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=3
  User=USERNAMEHERE
  ExecStart=rnsd --service

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

Be sure to replace ``USERNAMEHERE`` with the user you want to run ``rnsd`` as.

To manually start ``rnsd`` run:

.. code:: text

  sudo systemctl start rnsd

If you want to automatically start ``rnsd`` at boot, run:

.. code:: text

  sudo systemctl enable rnsd

Userspace Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively you can use a user systemd service instead of a system wide one. This way the whole setup can be done as a regular user.
Create a user systemd service files ``~/.config/systemd/user/rnsd.service`` with the following content:

.. code:: text

  [Unit]
  Description=Reticulum Network Stack Daemon
  After=default.target

  [Service]
  # If you run Reticulum on WiFi devices,
  # or other devices that need some extra
  # time to initialise, you might want to
  # add a short delay before Reticulum is
  # started by systemd:
  # ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 10
  Type=simple
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=3
  ExecStart=RNS_BIN_DIR/rnsd --service

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target

Replace ``RNS_BIN_DIR`` with the path to your Reticulum binary directory (eg. /home/USERNAMEHERE/rns/bin).

Start user service:

.. code:: text

  systemctl --user daemon-reload
  systemctl --user start rnsd.service

If you want to automatically start ``rnsd`` without having to log in as the USERNAMEHERE, do:

.. code:: text
  
  sudo loginctl enable-linger USERNAMEHERE
  systemctl --user enable rnsd.service
